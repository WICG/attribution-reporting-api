# Notes


## Nan Lin: FIFO proposal [https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/1228](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/1228)



* Currently we have a limit of the # of distinct destination for unexpired sources (per pub source). Once a pub registers 100 destinations, subsequent registrations will fail
* Got feedback that this is negative impact. We would like to change this behavior to kick out old sources in favor of new sources.
* Starting in 127, we formulate this as a priority based q so developers can prioritize, browser can keep track of registrations with higher priority. Registrations beyond this limit will be deleted
* To mitigate history reconstruction attack, we add a new limit for the # of registrations per day.
* Charlie: why do we need a limit?
    * Without a limit: ad tech can keep registering new destinations. We have a per minute limit, after 30 days you can register quite a lot of destinations
    * In the worst case in 30 days, can have 30*100 for the per-day limit (unique destinations)
* David: specifics are in another issue (1217)
* Nan: that’s the explainer spec change for this change
* David: any visibility for the publisher?
* Nan: if publisher site registers more than this, they can use this new behavior, if they want to keep the old behavior, they can use the priority field to recover the existing system
* David: individual ad-techs that are registering sources, they can control how this works. Does the publisher get any affordance? Learn whether their advertisers are being restricted. A big site could have many hundreds of advertisers
* Nan: currently nothing, but could consider sending debug reports to publisher site as well
* David: understand its a “rich man’s problem”, but it’s an assumption we want to make
* David: timeline?
* Nan: Chrome 128. Right now it’s default disabled, but plan to enable it in M128. Backwards incompatible since we change the queue semantics
* Charlie: Impact of the new limit?
* Nan: don’t expect big impact since it’s the same as the existing impact
* Charlie: Current limit is just pending impressions
* Nan: this one is also for pending sources and also daily
* Charlie: The way the current limit works is that we keep track of the pending impressions. That has a limit of 100. When there is a new impression. Now. from what I understand, keep that and instead if there is a 100 in storage, we’ll just kick out an old one. Always capped on 100. Per day - 100 unique destinations per day which could be more restrictive than pending because at a certain point won’t you be locked out also. Keeping a count of how many unique destinations you had today
* Nan: the new sources will be dropped.
* Charlie: different, now we have a system, where before you could ping-ping, flush out old impressions, but now we could be stuck by the day limit ? 
* Nan: We only count pending sources - this new limit is strictly more restrictive. 
* Charlie: How do we keep track ?
* Nan: It counts all the destinations for unexpired sources within a day per publisher site per reporting site. Sources created within that day that haven’t expired yet.
* Charlie: when would that be hit and the total one wouldn’t
* Nan: new one is fifo, this one is lifo
* David: you use the term “impression”. This mechanism is implying any registered source
* Charlie: yes that’s right
* Vikas: Just to replay. The FIFO limits is so you can monitor 100 sources at a time. LIFO limits about consuming 100 destinations a day


## David Dabbs topic: ARA adjacent



* Aggregated mechanism for private aggregation API → talk on the github. Which tree to bark up.
* Charlie: yep that’s right.
* David: Filtering IDs / batching Ids, etc.
