# Notes



* [John D] [Issue 648](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/648): Add a scheduled reporting time to the report for the event-level API. Previously discussed on issue 47. Challenge: when processing reports on the server, easier to debug things if you know when the browser “wanted” to send the report. Example: user clicks an ad, converted day after click, then the user closed browser and didn’t open for 1 month. When the ad-tech gets the report, they don’t know when the conversion occurred. Useful for utility/data quality and also for debugging.
    * Recap of previous discussion: doesn’t seem like too bad of a change, because it does reveal something that we don’t provide absolute certainty about today. But it’s not common that there’s uncertainty today. 
    * Current thinking: makes sense to add this.
    * Comments:
        * Alois B: When will a report be dropped if it’s not sent previously?
        * John D: Overall browser doesn’t have an intentional “drop dead” date to not send a report (even 90 days later, the browser would attempt to send the report). The main issue is likely network retries (e.g., fail to contact the reporting server) but this is limited to 3 retries to avoid persistent ping that could be used for presence tracking. We think 3 is enough, Chrome’s implementation also tries to only send reports when it thinks there is an active network connection to avoid “wasting” retries.
        * Alois B: In favor of knowing the intended window. 
        * Brian M: Seems like reports sent too far outside the window will be dropped anyway. If we get a report 90 days later, wouldn’t consider it. Suggest adding an ultimate expiry to prevent needing logic to deal with very late reports. 
        * Alois B: Agree that reports that are late aren’t useful for day to day, but it is still useful to be able to manage the logic on ad-tech side to know how often they are dropped. 
        * John D: Agree that the debugging aspect could be nice so that ad-tech knows, but it’s not ideal to send this so late. Expect that different ad-techs might want different cutoffs, so if we were to add it, might make sense for reporting origin to determine it’s own drop-dead date as part of the API surface.
        * Brian M: Perhaps option to allow ad-techs to request report after expiration period.
        * John D: have previously discussed reporting origin configurations (e.g. cloud provider), so maybe this is something that could be a reporting origin level configuration rather than something that has to be annotated on every call to the API. From user perspective, want to prevent using the bandwidth if the report won’t even be used by the ad-tech.
        * Brian M: would also give browser an opportunity to clean-up reports that won’t be sent.
* [John D] [Issue 649](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/649): Allow filtering aggregation keys
    * Another nuanced topic on filtering. Today, when creating an aggregate report, we only support filtering for the trigger pieces or the trigger itself; key-piece filtering allows you to control what to add to the aggregation keys based on filters. 
        * Does not support controlling what keys you contribute to at trigger time. 
        * Today, contribute to keys that you provide values for. So it’s only determined by trigger side information. If wanted to control this based on cross-site information (e.g., for clicks vs views), you cannot do it today. We could allow support for this if we extend the trigger side JSON. 
        * Looking to understand if there’s support for this and understand use-cases not covered by the current model.
    * Comments:
        * Alois B: would be interesting to selectively track some types of events and managing budget. Previously raised an issue about selectively using budget for different types of triggers.
        * John D: possible to control based on advertiser-side (trigger) only info to some extent today. It’s possible to only contribute to 1 bucket for a page view and then contribute to 10 for a sale. The issue is whether the conversion is valuable or not based on impression side information. For example, if the ad was showing the product the user bought changes what buckets to contribute to, then it can’t be done today. 
    * Planning to follow up offline, please comment on the issue.
* [John D] Next meeting date? December 26th vs Jan 9th? ([Issue 80](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/80))
    * Based on the issue, looks like Jan 9th will be the next meeting
