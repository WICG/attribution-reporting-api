Glossary
--------

-   **Publisher**: Page that shows ads, sells ad slots

-   **Advertiser**: Purchaser of ad slots, conversions happen on advertiser sites

-   **Conversion**: The completion of a meaningful (advertiser specified) user action on the advertiser's web site by a user who has previously interacted with an ad from that advertiser.

-   **Event-level data**: Data that can be tied back to a specific low-level event; not aggregated

-   **Click-through-conversion (CTC)**: A conversion attributed to an ad click

Motivation
----------

Currently, the web ad industry measures conversions via identifiers they
can associate across sites. These identifiers tie information about
which ads were clicked to information about activity on the advertiser's
site (the conversion). This allows advertisers to measure ROI, and for
the entire ads ecosystem to understand how well ads perform.

Since the ads industry today uses common identifiers across advertiser
and publisher sites to track conversions, these common identifiers can
be used to enable other forms of cross-site tracking.

This doesn’t have to be the case, though, especially in cases where
identifiers such as third-party cookies are either unavailable or
undesirable. A new API surface can be added to the web platform to
satisfy this use case without them, in a way that provides better
privacy to users.

This API alone will not be able to support all conversion measurement
use cases, such as view conversions, or even click conversion reporting
with richer / more accurate conversion data. We envision this API as
one of potentially many new APIs that will seek to reproduce valid
advertising use cases in the web platform in a privacy preserving way.
In particular, we think this API could be extended by using server side
aggregation to provide richer data, which we are continuing to explore.

Prior Art
---------

There is an alternative [Ad Click Attribution](https://github.com/WICG/ad-click-attribution) draft spec in the WICG. See this [WebKit blog post](https://webkit.org/blog/8943/privacy-preserving-ad-click-attribution-for-the-web/) for more details.

Brave has published and implemented an [Ads Confirmation Protocol](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Security-and-privacy-model-for-ad-confirmations).

Overview
========

Attribution Source Declaration
----------------------

### Registering attribution sources for anchor tag navigations

An attribution source is an anchor tag with special attributes:

`<a attributiondestination="[eTLD+1]" attributionsourceeventid="[64-bit unsigned integer]"
attributionexpiry="[64-bit signed integer]" attributionreportto="[origin]"
attributionsourcepriority="[64-bit signed integer"]>`

Attribution source attributes:

-   `attributiondestination`: an origin whose eTLD+1 is where attribution will be triggered for this source.

-   `attributionsourceeventid`: A DOMString encoding a 64-bit unsigned integer which represents the event-level data associated with this source. This will be limited to 64 bits of information but the value can vary for browsers that want a higher level of privacy.

-   `attributionexpiry`: (optional) expiry in milliseconds for when the source should be deleted. Default is 30 days, with a maximum value of 30 days. The maximum expiry can also vary between browsers.

-   `attributionreportto`: (optional) the desired endpoint that the attribution report for this source should go to. Default is the top level origin of the page.

-   `attributionsourcepriority`: (optional) a signed 64-bit integer used to prioritize this source with respect to other matching sources. When a trigger redirect is received, the browser will find the matching source with highest `attributionsourcepriority` value and generate a report. The other sources will not generate reports.

Clicking on an anchor tag that specifies these attributes will create a new attribution source event that will be handled according to [Handling an attribution source event](#handling-an-attribution-source-event)

### Registering attribution sources for window.open() navigations

An attribution source can be registered for navigations initiated by [`window.open()`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#dom-open).

A source is registered in a call to `window.open()` by providing attribution source attributes within the `features` parameter:

```
window.open("https://dest.example", "_blank",     
 "noopener,attributionsourceeventid=1234,attributiondestination=https://dest.example,\
 attributionreportto=https://reporter.example,attributionexpiry=604800000");)
```

At the time window.open() is invoked with these attributes specified in `features`, if the associated window has a [transient activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#transient-activation), an attribution source event will be created and handled following [Handling an attribution source event](#handling-an-attribution-source-event).

### Handling an attribution source event

An attribution source event will be logged to storage if the resulting document being
navigated to ends up sharing the an eTLD+1 with the `attributionDestination` origin. Concretely, this logs <`attributionsourceeventid`,
`attributiondestination`, `attributionreportto`, `attributionexpiry`> to a new
browser storage area.

When a source is logged for <`attributionreportto`,
`attributiondestination`>, existing sources matching this pair will be
looked up in storage. If the matching sources have been triggered at
least once (i.e. have scheduled a report), they will be removed from
browser storage and will not be eligible for further reporting. Any
pending reports for these sources will still be sent.

An attribution source will be eligible for reporting if any page on the	
`attributiondestination` eTLD+1 (advertiser site) triggers attribution for the	
associated reporting origin.


### Publisher-side Controls for Attribution Source Declaration

In order to prevent arbitrary third parties from registering sources without the publisher’s knowledge, the Attribution Reporting API will need to be enabled in child contexts by a new [Feature Policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-feature-policy/):

```
<iframe src="https://advertiser.example" allow="attribution-reporting 'src'">

<a … id="..." attributionreportto="https://ad-tech.example"></a>

</iframe>
```

The API will be enabled by default in the top-level context and in same-origin children. Any script running in these contexts can declare a source with any reporting origin. Publishers who wish to explicitly disable the API for all parties can do so via an [HTTP header](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-feature-policy/#feature-policy-http-header-field).

Without a Feature Policy, a top-level document and cooperating iframe could recreate this functionality. This is possible by using [postMessage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#dom-window-postmessage) to send the `attributionsourceeventid`, `attributionreportto`, `attributiondestination` values to the top level document who can then wrap the iframe in an anchor tag (with some additional complexities behind handling clicks on the iframe). Using Feature Policy prevents the need for these hacks. This is inline with the classification of powerful features as discussed on [this issue](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-feature-policy/issues/252).

Triggering Attribution
-----------------------

This API will use a mechanism for triggering an attribution source similar to the
[Ad Click Attribution Proposal](https://wicg.github.io/ad-click-attribution/index.html#legacytriggering).

Attribution can only be triggered for a source on a page whose eTLD+1 matches the eTLD+1 of the site provided in `attributiondestination`.  A source can be triggered through an HTTP GET to
its `attributionreportto` origin, that redirects to a [.well-known](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785)
location.
This redirect is useful, because this mechanism enables the reporting origin to make server-side decisions about when attribution reports should trigger.
Note that `.well-known` is only used to register a path that the browser will understand; it shouldn't point to any actual resource, since the request will be cancelled internally.

Triggering attribution requires the `attribution-reporting` Feature Policy to be enabled in the context the request is made. As described in [Publisher Controls for Attribution Source Declaration](#publisher-side-controls-for-attribution-source-declaration), this Feature Policy will be enabled by default in the top-level context and in same-origin children, but disabled in cross-origin children.

Today, conversion pixels are frequently used to register conversions on
advertiser pages. These can be repurposed to trigger attribution in
this API:

```
<img src="https://ad-tech.example/conversiontracker"/>
```
`https://ad-tech.example/conversiontracker` can be redirected to `https://ad-tech.example/.well-known/attribution-reporting/trigger-attribution`
to trigger attribution for all matching sources.

The browser will treat redirects to a URL of the form:
`https://<attributionreportto>/.well-known/attribution-reporting/trigger-attribution[?trigger-data=<trigger-data>&priority=<priority>&dedup-key=<dedup-key>]`

as a special request. The query string for the request contains additional information about the attribution trigger:
- `trigger-data`: optional data to identify the triggering event
- `priority`: optional signed 64-bit integer representing the priority of this trigger compared to other triggers for the same source.
- `dedup-key`: optional signed 64-bit integer which will be used to deduplicate multiple triggers which contain the same dedup-key for a single source

When the special redirect is detected, the browser will schedule an attribution
report as detailed in [Trigger attribution algorithm](#trigger-attribution-algorithm).

### Data limits and noise

The `attributionsourceeventid` will be limited to 64 bits of information to enable
uniquely identifying an ad click.

The advertiser-side data must therefore be limited quite strictly, by limiting the amount of data and by applying noise to the data. Our strawman
initial proposal is to allow 3 bits of trigger data, with 5%
noise applied — that is, with 5% chance, we send a random 3 bits, and the
other 95% of the time we send the real trigger data. See
[privacy considerations](#trigger-data) for more information,
including speculative thoughts on the hard question of going farther
and [adding noise to whether or not the attribution report is even sent](#speculative-adding-noise-to-the-attribution-of-the-source-itself).
In any case, noise values should be allowed to vary between browsers.

Disclaimer: Adding or removing a single bit of data has large
trade-offs in terms of user privacy and usability to advertisers: 
* Less bits is more private but less usable to advertisers
* More bits is less private but more usable to advertisers.
Browsers should concretely evaluate the trade-offs from these two
perspectives before setting a limit. As such, this number is subject to
change based on community feedback. Our encoding scheme should also
support fractions of bits, as it’s possible to limit data to values
from 0-5 (~2.6 bits of information)

### Trigger attribution algorithm

When the browser receives a attribution trigger redirect on a URL matching
the `attributiondestination` eTLD+1, it looks up all sources in storage that
match <`attributionreportto`, `attributiondestination`> and picks the one with
the greatest `attributionsourcepriority`. If multiple sources have the greatest
`attributionsourcepriority`, the browser picks the one that was stored most
recently.

The browser then schedules a report for the source that was picked by storing
 {`attributionreportto`, `attributiondestination` eTLD+1, `attributionsourceeventid`, [decoded](#data-encoding) trigger-data, priority, dedup-key} for the source.
Scheduled reports will be sent as detailed in [Sending scheduled reports](#sending-scheduled-reports).

The browser will only create reports for a source if the trigger's dedup-key has not already been associated with a report for that source.

Each source is only allowed to schedule a maximum of three reports
(see [Triggering attribution multiple times for the same source](#triggering-attribution-multiple-times-for-the-same-source)). The browser will delete sources which have sent three reports.

If a source already has three scheduled reports when a new report is being scheduled,
the browser will compare the priority of the new report with the priorities of the scheduled reports for that source.
If the new report has the lowest priority, it will be ignored. Otherwise, the browser will
delete the scheduled report with the lowest priority and schedule the new report.

### Multiple sources for the same trigger (Multi-touch)

If multiple sources were clicked and associated with a single attribution trigger, send reports for the one with the highest priority.
If no priority is specified, the browser performs last-touch.

There are many possible alternatives to this,
like providing a choice of rules-based attribution models. However, it
isn’t clear the benefits outweigh the additional complexity. Additionally, models other than last-click potentially leak more
cross-site information if sources are clicked across different
sites.

### Triggering attribution multiple times for the same source

Many ad clicks end up converting multiple times, for instance if a user
goes through a checkout and a purchase flow. To support this in a
privacy preserving way, we need to make sure that triggering a source multiple times does not leak too much data.

One possible solution, outlined in this document, is for browsers to specify
a maximum number of reports that can be sent for a single source. In this document
our initial proposal is 3.

However, this limit may not be sufficient in cases where attribution triggers consitute a long funnel. For example,
a checkout flow involving: page visit, add to cart, signup, purchase would prevent the purchase trigger from
being reported.

To address this, the `priority` query param in the trigger redirect can be used to prioritize the purchase trigger
over less important triggers like the page visit trigger.

Note that triggering attribution for the same source multiple times does not refresh
the reporting windows (see [Sending Scheduled Reports](#sending-scheduled-reports)).

Note that from a usability perspective, it is important that all
reports for the same source are allowed the same amount
of data. Otherwise, it becomes quite difficult for advertisers to
efficiently use the space of possible data values.

Sending Scheduled Reports
-------------------------

After an attribution source is successfully registered, a
schedule of reporting windows and deadlines associated with that
source begins. The time between the click and expiry can
be split into multiple reporting windows, at the end of which the
browser will send scheduled reports for that source.

Each reporting window has a deadline, and only reports created
before that deadline can be sent in that window. An example of deadlines
and windows a browser could choose are:

2 days minus 1 hour: Reports will be sent 2 days from source registration
time

7 days minus 1 hour: Reports will be sent 7 days from source registration
time

`attributionexpiry`: Reports will be sent `attributionexpiry`
milliseconds plus one hour from source registration time

If `attributionexpiry` occurs before the 7 day window deadline it will be used as the next reporting window. For example, if `attributionexpiry` is 3 days, there will be two deadlines, 2 days minus one hour and `attributionexpiry`. If `attributionexpiry` is before the 2 day deadline, the 2 day deadline will still be used. 

When a report is scheduled, it will be delayed until the next
applicable reporting window for the associated source. Once the
window has finished, the report will be sent out of band.

If there are multiple reports for a source scheduled within the
same window, the reports will be sent at the same time but in a random
order.

The report may be sent at a later date if the browser was not running
when the window finished. In this case, reports will be sent on startup.
The browser may also decide to delay some of these reports for a
short random time on startup, so that they cannot be joined together
easily by a given reporting origin.

Note that to improve utility, it might be possible to randomly send
reports throughout each reporting window.

### Attribution Reports

To send a report, the browser will make a non-credentialed (i.e. without session cookies) secure
HTTP POST request to:

```
https://attributionreportto/.well-known/attribution-reporting/report-attribution
```

The report data is included in the request body as a JSON object with the following keys:

-   `source_event_id`: 64-bit event id set on the attribution source

-   `trigger_data`: 3-bit data set in the attribution trigger redirect

The advertiser site’s eTLD+1 will be added as the Referrer. Note that it
might be useful to advertise which data limits were used in the
report, but it isn’t included here.

It also may be beneficial to send reports as JSON instead of in the
report URL. JSON reports could allow this API to leverage the Reporting
API in the future should it be desirable.

Data Encoding
-----------------

The source event id and trigger data should be in a way that is amenable
to any privacy level a browser would want to choose (i.e. the number of
distinct data states supported).

The input values will be 64-bit integers which the browser will interpret
modulo its maximum data value chosen by the browser. The browser
will take the input and performs the equivalent of:

```
function getData(input, max_value) {
  return input % max_value;
}
```

The benefit of this method over using a fixed bit mask is that it allows
browsers to implement max\_values that aren’t multiples of 2. That is,
browers can choose a "fractional" bit limit if they want to.

Sample Usage
============

`publisher.example` wants to show ads on their site, so they contract out to
`ad-tech.example`. `ad-tech.example`'s script in the main document creates a
cross-origin iframe to host the third party advertisement for
`toasters.example`, and sets `ad-tech.example` to be an allowed reporting origin.

Within the iframe, `toasters.example` code annotates their anchor tags to use
the `ad-tech.example` reporting origin, and uses a source event id value that allows
`ad-tech.example` to identify the ad click (12345678)
```
<iframe src="https://ad-tech-3p.example/show-some-ad" allow="attribution-reporting ‘src’ (https://ad-tech.example)">
...
<a 
  href="https://toasters.example/purchase"
  attributiondestination="https://toasters.example"
  attributionsourceeventid="12345678"
  attributionreportto="https://ad-tech.example"
  attributionexpiry=604800000>
...
</iframe>
```

A user clicks on the ad and this opens a window that lands on a URL to
`toasters.example/purchase`. An attribution source is logged to browser storage
since the landing page matches the `attributiondestination` eTLD+1. The following data is
stored:

```
{
  attributionsourceeventid: 12345678,
  attributiondestination: https://toasters.example,
  attributionreportto: https://ad-tech.example,
  attributionexpiry: <now() + 604800>
}
```

2 days later, the user buys something on `toasters.example`. `toasters.example`
triggers attribution on the few different ad-tech companies it buys
ads on, including `ad-tech.example`, by adding conversion pixels:

```
<img src="https://ad-tech.example/trigger-attribution?model=toastmaster3000&price=$49.99&..." />
```

`ad-tech.example` receives this request, and decides to trigger attribution
on `toasters.example`. They must compress all of the data into
3 bits, so `ad-tech.example` chooses to encode the value as “2" (e.g. some
bucketed version of the purchase value). They respond with a 302
redirect to:
```
https://ad-tech.example/.well-known/attribution-reporting/trigger-attribution?trigger-data=2
```

The browser sees this request, and schedules a report to be
sent. The report is associated with the 7 day deadline as the
2 day deadline has passed. Roughly 5 days later, `ad-tech.example` receives
the following HTTP POST:
```
URL:
https://ad-tech.example/.well-known/attribution-reporting/report-attribution

body:
{
  "source_event_id": "12345678",
  "trigger_data": "2"
}
```

Privacy Considerations
======================
The main privacy goal of the API is to make _linking identity_ between two different top-level sites difficult. This happens when either a request or a Javascript environment has two user IDs from two different sites simultaneously.

In this API, the 64-bit source ID can encode a user ID from the publisher’s top level site, but the low entropy, noisy trigger data could only encode a small part of a user ID from the advertiser’s top-level site. The source ID and the trigger data are never exposed to a Javascript environment together, and the request that includes both of them is sent without credentials and at a different time from either event, so the request adds little new information linkable to these events.

While this API _does_ allow you to learn "which ad clicks converted", it isn’t enough to link the user's identity on the publisher's and advertiser's side, unless there is serious abuse of the API, i.e. abusers are using error correcting codes and many clicks to slowly and probabilistically learn advertiser IDs associated with publisher ones. We explore some mitigations to this attack below.


Trigger Data
-------------------

Trigger data, e.g. advertiser side data, is extremely important for critical use cases like
reporting the *purchase value* of a conversion. However, too much advertiser side
data could be used to link advertiser identity with publisher
identity.

Mitigations against this are to provide only coarse information (only a
few bits at a time), and introduce some noise to the trigger data. Even
sophisticated attackers will therefore need to invoke the API many times
(through many clicks) to join identity between sites with high
confidence.

Note that this noise still allows for aggregate measurement of bucket sizes
with an unbiased estimator. See generic approaches of dealing with
[Randomized response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response) for
a starting point.

Reporting Delay 
-----------------

By bucketing reports within a small number reporting deadlines, it
becomes harder to associate a report with the identity of the
user on the advertiser’s site via timing side channels.

Reports within the same reporting window occur within an anonymity
set with all others during that time period. For example, if we didn’t
bucket reports, the reports (which contain publisher ids)
could be easily joined up with the advertiser’s first party information
via correlating timestamps.

Note that the delay windows / deadlines chosen represent a trade-off
with utility, since it becomes harder to properly assign credit to a
click if the time from click to conversion is not known. That is,
time-to-conversion is an important signal for proper
attribution. Browsers should make sure that this trade-off is concretely
evaluated for both privacy and utility before deciding on a delay.

Limits on the number of attribution triggers
-----------------------------------------

If the advertiser is allowed to cycle through many possible
`attributionreportto` origins (via injecting many `<img>` tags on the
page), then the publisher and advertiser don’t necessarily have to agree
apriori on what origin to use, and which origin actually ends up getting
used reveals some extra information.

To prevent abuse, it makes sense for browsers to add limits here, potentially
on a per-page load or per-reporting epoch basis.

Clearing Site Data
------------------

Attribution source data and attribution reports in browser storage should be clearable using existing “clear browsing data" functionality offered by browsers.

Reporting cooldown
------------------

To limit the amount of user identity leakage between a <publisher,
advertiser> pair, the browser should throttle the amount of total
information sent through this API in a given time period for a user. The
browser should set a maximum number of attribution reports per
<publisher, advertiser, user> tuple per time period. If this
threshold is hit, the browser will disable the API for the
rest of the time period for that user.

The longer the cooldown windows are, the harder it is to abuse the API
and join identity. Ideally report thresholds should be low enough to
avoid leaking too much sensitive information, with cooldown windows as
long as practically possible.

It’s an open question what specific limits are possible here.

Speculative: Limits based on first party storage
------------------------------------------------

Another mitigation on joining identity across publisher and advertiser
sites is to limit the number of reports for any given
<publisher, advertiser> pair until the advertiser clears their
site data. This could occur via the [Clear-Site-Data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Clear-Site-Data)
header or by explicit user action.

To prevent linking across deletions, we might need to introduce new
options to the Clear-Site-Data header to only clear data after the page
has unloaded.

Speculative: Adding noise to the attribution of the source itself
--------------------------------------------------------

Another way to add privacy to this system is to add noise not only to
the [reported trigger data value](#data-limits-and-noise),
but also to whether attribution was triggered in the first place. That is:

-   With some probability *p*, sources that are triggered will be dropped

-   With some probability *q*, sources that have not been triggered will be triggered, and given random `trigger-data`.

The biggest problem with this scheme is that attribution trigger events are, in
general, *rare*. Additionally, different advertisers can have wildly
different *attribution rates*. These two facts make it very hard to pick
a *q* that works reliably without drowning out the signal with noise.
We’re still thinking of solutions here.

Additionally, sending reports for sources that never
actually converted could have real monetary impact on advertisers that
pay per attributed source. Tight bounds on error estimation will be crucial for
correct billing in these cases.

Open Questions
==============

Multiple Reporting Endpoints Per Attributed Source
-------------------------------------------

An advertiser may want to send reports to multiple reporting partners at
the same time for the same attributed source. This is very tricky to get right without revealing any
extra information. Allowing different trigger data for different
reporting endpoints makes things even more difficult.

This problem becomes a bit easier if reporting partners mutually trust
each other, and can share reporting server-to-server.
